# # Pipeline
#
# Thus far, we've applied the preprocessing, epoching, and averaging steps to a single participant only.
# However, we typically study a larger group of participants, since (a) data from a single participant is typically still quite noisy, and (b) we want to generalize our findings to the population from which our participants were drawn.
#
# Therefore, we need to repeat the analysis for all participants by creating an **analysis pipeline** that takes each participant's raw data as an input and performs the same set of processing steps on them.
#
# We will first do this manually (using a loop) and then with a pre-packaged automatic pipeline function.

# ## Custom pipeline
#
# We'll start by creating a custom pipeline that repeats the preprocessing, epoching, and averaging steps for all participants.
# This is as easy as taking all the code from the previous chapters and, instead of reading only a single raw EEG file, putting it inside a `for` loop that iterates over all raw EEG files.
#
# Let's first download some more datasets (for the sake of time, we're only using 10 participants instead of all 40):
#
# %% tags=["output_scroll"]
files_dict = get_erpcore('N170', participants=10, path='data')

# %%
files_dict

# %% [markdown]
# Then we'll run a `for` loop with all the processing steps inside it.
# Before the loop, we create empty lists where we will store the processed outputs (in this case, the evokeds) for all participants.
#
# %% tags=["output_scroll"]

# ## Neuro Lab pipeline
#
# At the [Abdel Rahman Lab for Neurocognitive Psychology](https://abdelrahmanlab.com) at HU Berlin (the "Neuro Lab," for short), we've developed a Python package that provides a fully automated EEG processing pipeline.
# The pipeline was originally developed and published in the MATLAB language by {cite:t}`fromer2018`.
# The more recent Python version is available at [https://hu-neuro-pipeline.readthedocs.io](https://hu-neuro-pipeline.readthedocs.io).
#
# The pipeline is fully automated in the sense that it takes raw EEG data from multiple participants as an input and performs a number of standardized processing step at the participant and group level with minimal user input.
# The typical steps are visualized in this flowchart:
#

#
# Processing steps in the `hu-neuro-pipeline` package.
# Source: [Docs](https://hu-neuro-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/processing_overview.html).
# :::
#
# The pipeline package only has one main function, called `group_pipeline()`.
# Let's use it to process the same example data as before:

                                         montage='biosemi64',

                                                     'roi': ['PO8']},

# %% [markdown]
# In this example we've specified:
#
# * The input and output file paths (`raw_files`, `log_files`, `output_dir`)
# * Some preprocessing options (`montage`, `ica_method`, `ica_n_components`; note that the pipeline also applies a 0.1--40 Hz band-pass filter by default)
# * The event codes of interest for epoching (`triggers`; note that the pipeline also applies a default peak-to-peak rejection at 200 ÂµV)
# * Some event codes to skip (`skip_log_conditions`; anything other than faces and houses)
# * The definition of our ERP component(s) of interest (`components`; here only the N170)
# * Rules to create by-participant condition averages/evokeds (`average_by`; here for faces and cars)
#
# A (long) list of these and all other input options is available on the [pipeline documentation website](https://hu-neuro-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_inputs.html).
#
# The pipeline returns three objects (which also get written as text files into the `output_dir`):
#
# * `trials`: A data frame with the **single trial data** for all participants, also containing the single trial ERP amplitudes (averaged across the time window and channels of interest)
# * `evokeds`: A data frame with the **averaged (evoked) ERP amplitudes** for all time points, channels, and participants
# * `config`: A dictionary with the **pipeline configuration**
#
# Let's look of each of these in turn:
#
# %% [markdown]
# ### Single trial data
#
# %%
trials

# %% [markdown]
# We could (and will!) use this for statistically analyzing the ERP component(s) of interest.
# Specifically, we can fit a mixed-effects model that tests if the single trial N170 amplitudes differs as a function of the condition of the trial (face vs. car).
#
# %% [markdown]
# ### Evokeds
#
# %%
evokeds

# %% [markdown]
# The evokeds can be used for plotting the ERP time courses for both conditions.
# For this, we will use the [seaborn package](https://seaborn.pydata.org), which is great for visualizing tabular data (similar to the [ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) in R).

# %%
_ = sns.lineplot(evokeds, x='time', y='PO8', hue='label',
                 estimator='mean', errorbar='se')

# %% [markdown]
# We can make the plot yet a bit prettier by adding custom x-axis limits, vertical and horizontal lines at zero, and more informative axis labels:
#
# %%
_ = sns.lineplot(evokeds, x='time', y='PO8', hue='label',
                 estimator='mean', errorbar='se')
_ = plt.margins(x=0.0, y=0.1)
_ = plt.xlim(-0.2, 0.8)
_ = plt.axvline(0.0, color='black', linestyle='--')
_ = plt.axhline(0.0, color='black', linestyle='--')
_ = plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PO8 amplitude (ÂµV)')

# %% [markdown]
# ### Pipeline configuration
#
# %% [markdown]
# Finally, the `config` output is a dictionary with information about the pipeline run.
# It contains all the user-specified and default input arguments plus some new information that the pipeline has computed along the way (e.g., `'auto_rejected_epochs'`, the rejected epochs for each participant):
#
# %% tags=["output_scroll"]
config

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercises
#
# 1. Run the EEG analysis pipeline (using a custom `for` loop or the `group_pipeline()` function) for 10 participants from a different ERP CORE experiment (valid experiment names are `'N170'`, `'MMN'`, `'N2pc'`, `'N400'`, `'P3'`, or `'ERN'`).
#    Create evokeds for the two conditions of interest and visualize their time course.
