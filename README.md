This course provides a very brief introduction into analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) data.

It uses the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and the [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) package for EEG analysis.
Python and MNE-Python are open source software, which means that they are free to use and co-created and constantly improved by a large community of users.
While prior programming experience is useful to follow the course materials, no specific knowledge of the Python language or MNE-Python is required.
