# Introduction to EEG analysis

This course provides a very brief introduction into analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) data.

It uses the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and the [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) package for EEG analysis.
Python and MNE-Python are open source software, which means that they are free to use and co-created and constantly improved by a large community of users.
While prior programming experience is useful to follow the course materials, no specific knowledge of the Python language or MNE-Python is required.

## Usage

There are three different ways to follow along with the course materials:

|                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| üí§ **Static**               | Browse through the non-interactive version of the notebooks as listed below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| üåç **Online** (recommended) | At the top of each notebook, hit the "Open in Colab" button to open an interactive version of the notebook in your browser. This allows you to run and/or modify the code in the notebook without having to install anything on your computer. You can also save your changes to your own Google Drive.                                                                                                |
| üíª **Offline**              | Download the course materials from GitHub via [this link](https://github.com/alexenge/intro-to-eeg/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip them, and open the Python scripts (in the ``py`` folder) or the notebooks (in the ``ipynb`` folder) in your code editor. Note that this is the most advance version, as it requires you to setup your own Python environment and install the required packages. |
